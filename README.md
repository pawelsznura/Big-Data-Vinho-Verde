Prediction of Vinho Verde white wine quality 


The Wine Quality Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used to build a model to predict the wine quality as a whole number on a scale from 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent). Quality evaluation currently relies fully on human experts, which can be an expensive process. Therefore, this work will explore the use of machine learning techniques to predict the quality based on the physicochemical data.
